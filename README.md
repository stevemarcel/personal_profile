# personal_profile

My personal profile page. This site was built using different methods. Each method is seperated into different branches as:

(1) flexbox branch.

(2) gridbox branch.

(3) [materializecss](http://materializecss.com) branch.

The name of each branch specifies the method used in creating them. This website is fully responsive on all screens.
