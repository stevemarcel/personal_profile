# personal_profile

My personal profile page. This site was built using different methods. Each method is separated into different branches as:

(1) flexbox branch.

(2) gridbox branch.

(3) [materializecss](http://materializecss.com) branch.

The name of each branch specifies the method used in creating them. This website is fully responsive on all screens.

The current master branch is merged with the [materializecss](http://materializecss.com) branch. This branch was built with [sass](http://sass-lang.com) and for the icons [font awesome](http://fontawesome.com) was used.
